        Welcome to Squad Finder\'s Mortar Calculator. Usage of this app is fairly simple, allowing
        you to get rounds on target almost immediately.\n\nFirst, choose a map. Once a map has
        been chosen, the application will pop up some details about the map, along with
        a movable map where you can place mortar and target markers. To place a marker, double
        tap the map in the location where you would like the mark.\n\nIf you do not like
        your marks, you may edit them by choosing the option below the map.
        If you are satisfied, you must now move to the assigning phase.\n\nIn the assigning phase,
        you must assign targets to each mortar that you have placed. Finally,
        once every mortar has targets (each mortar can have more than 1 target), you can move
        to the calculate phase, where azimuth and angle are calculated for you.
