The limited vehicles in play serve only to supply FOBs or provide limited fire support as the dense forests limit their effectiveness and allow them to be ambushed from any side. There are, however, a few places where a well positioned vehicle can slaughter Infantry that are not careful. The map is not so large as to necessitate the use of vehicles for transportation. The fighting consists mostly of close-quarters or mid-range firefights in the urban areas or in the forests.",
